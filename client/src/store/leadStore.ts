## The Signal

${l.angle}

This isn't speculation. Three peers in your space made nearly identical moves before posting outsized growth in the next two quarters.

## The Asset

We've put together a tear-down of how the top 5% of ${l.org}'s category are converting this exact signal into pipeline. No fluff. No ask.
